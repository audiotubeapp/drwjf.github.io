<h2>NASDAQ and NYSE</h2>
<p>The NYSE and Nasdaq have significant differences, including the size and number of listings, how trades are made, and also how they are perceived by investors.</p>

<p>By the value of listed companies, the NYSE and Nasdaq are the two largest exchanges in the world. The NYSE is home to many of the big "blue chip" companies that have existed for decades, like Walmart, Exxon Mobil, or General Electric. This is partly because the exchange has existed since 1792. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq has more companies than the NYSE, but has a wider spectrum in terms of the size of companies. Of course, the exchange is known for having the large tech-focused companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon, but there are many smaller listings on the Nasdaq as well.</p>

<p>Aside from the obvious differences in the size and types of listings, the NYSE and Nasdaq also have significant operational differences. The largest difference is that the NYSE is an auction market and the Nasdaq is a dealer market. In the former, the highest bid for a stock is matched with the lowest asking price. In the latter, buying and selling happens in split seconds electronically through dealers.</p>

<p>For various reasons, both stocks are seen a little differently by investors, as well. The NYSE is seen as the stock market for "tried and true" securities that have been, and will continue to be, the mainstays of the financial world for decades. The Nasdaq, on the other hand, is seen as a place for growth-oriented tech stocks. It was where the action was in the Dotcom boom and bust, and it's the place where the world's largest tech stocks are listed today. </p>


<h2>Realtime quote of stocks</h2>
<p>A standard quote on a security consists of a bid priceand an ask (offer) price. The bid price is what sellers would receive for the security and the ask price is what buyers must pay for the security. The more volume that is traded on a security will bring the bid and ask prices closer together. Historically, price quotes arrived via ticker tape that relied on telegraph technology. Over time, quotes began to be disseminated daily in newspapers and television broadcast. Brokerage customers who wanted a stock quote would rely on telephones where a broker would physically call down to a stock exchange and request a quote. With the rise of internet-based online trading, the cost for providing real-time quotes dropped significantly and soon became ubiquitous as of the learly 2010s.</p>

<h2>Corporate Action Calendar</h2>
<p>A corporate action is an event initiated by a public company that will bring an actual change to the securities—equity or debt—issued by the company. Corporate actions are typically agreed upon by a company's board of directors and authorized by the shareholders. Examples of corporate actions include stock splits, dividends, mergers and acquisitions, rights issues, and spin-offs.</p>

<p>Some corporate actions such as a dividend (for equity securities) or coupon payment (for debt securities) may have a direct financial impact on the shareholders or bondholders; another example is a call (early redemption) of a debt security. Other corporate actions such as stock split may have an indirect impact, as the increased liquidity of shares may cause the price of the stock to decrease.</p>

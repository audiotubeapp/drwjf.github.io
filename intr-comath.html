<h2>Answering The Questions</h2>

<h3>A Quiz Helps You Learn</h3>
<p>Why answer these questions?</p>
<p>Because you learn mathematics by doing it!</p>
<p>Just like learning guitar or tennis. Theory, then practice.</p>
<p>The questions are for you! So you can get practice.</p>
<p>Don't cheat yourself. Work hard on each question. Don't hurry, there is no time limit.</p>
<p>The quiz gets you to recall and use what you have learned. A proven way to learn.</p>

<h3>NOT a Test !</h3>
<p>The quiz is not a test, no one is judging you. Relax and enjoy learning.</p>

<h3>Take Your Time</h3>
<p>The questions are not timed ... take all day, and tomorrow as well if you want.</p>

<h3>Don't Cheat Yourself</h3>
<p>Taking shortcuts? Using a calculator to cheat? You may finish faster, but not learn anything! Then the whole thing is a waste of time.</p>

<h3>Pencil and Paper</h3>
<p>Use a pencil and paper when doing the questions ... make sketches, do sums.</p>
<p>Writing things down also helps you to learn.</p>

 
<h3>Right or Wrong you are a Winner</h3>
<p>Oh No! A wrong answer! Don't worry, trying your honest best to answer is what is important.</p>
<p>Think about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Got the right answer? Well Done! Now see how we solved it, you may learn new things. </li>
<li>Got it wrong? Then find out why you got it wrong and you are also a winner! You have learned something.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, learning from failure is one of the most important things for people to develop.</p>

<h3>Good for You</h3>
<p>Oh yes ... these questions are good for your mind, too.</p>

<h1>Contest of Math</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><b>CoMath</b>, is an application to help young students succeed in math. 100,000 quizzes of arithmetic, algebra, geometry with solution to help understanding the reasoning behind the formulas, equations, and numbers. It could be used for SAT or ACT prep too. <a href="/comath">Start contest now</a>, or install native app into your mobile phone to get more features. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1438026503"><img src="svg/appstore.svg" alt="Apple AppStore"></a> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wjf.com"><img src="svg/googleplay.svg" alt="Goolge Play"></a>.</p>

<h2>Why Math is Important</h2>
<p>Math, includes arithmetic, algebra, geometry and so on, is incredibly important in our lives and, without realizing it, we use mathematical concepts, as well as the skills we learn from doing math problems, every day. The laws of mathematics govern everything around us, and without a good understanding of them, one can encounter significant problems in life.</p>

<h3>Learning Math Is Good for Your Brain</h3>
<p>Research conducted by Dr. Tanya Evans of Stanford University indicates that children who know math are able to recruit certain brain regions more reliably, and have greater gray matter volume in those regions, than those who perform more poorly in math. The brain regions involved in higher math skills in high-performing children were associated with various cognitive tasks involving visual attention and decision-making.  While correlation may not imply causation, this study indicates that the same brain regions that help you do math are recruited in decision-making and attentional processes.</p>

<h3>Math helps you with your finances</h3>
<p>Math can be helpful for balancing your budget because you will have a good understanding of how to make sure that your costs are less than the money you have. Balancing oneâ€™s bank account, for example, is an important life skill that requires math in order to subtract balances. People who know math are therefore less likely to go into debt because they did not know how much money they had versus how much money they spent.</p>

<h3>Math helps us have better problem-solving skills</h3>
<p>Math helps us think analytically and have better reasoning abilities. Analytical thinking refers to the ability to think critically about the world around us. Reasoning is our ability to think logically about a situation. Analytical and reasoning skills are important because they help us solve problems and look for solutions. While it may seem farfetched to think that solving the train problem above can help you solve a problem in your life, the skills that you use in framing the problem, identifying the knowns and unknowns, and taking steps to solve the problem can be a very important strategy that can be applied to other problems in life.</p>

<h3>Math is used in practically every career in some way</h3>
<p>Obviously, mathematicians and scientists rely on mathematical principles to do the most basic aspects of their work such as test hypotheses. While scientific careers famously involve math, they are not the only careers to do so. Even operating a cash register requires that one understands basic arithmetic. People working in a factory must be able to do mental arithmetic to keep track of the parts on the assembly line and must, in some cases, manipulate fabrication software utilizing geometric properties (such as the dimensions of a part) in order to build their products. Really, any job requires math because you must know how to interpret your paycheck and balance your budget.</p>

<h3>Math is all around us and helps us understand the world better</h3>
<p>To live in a mathematically-driven world and not know math is like walking through an art museum with your eyes closed. Learning and appreciating math can help you appreciate things that you would not otherwise notice about the world. In reality, math is everywhere!</p>


<h2>Answering The Questions</h2>

<h3>A Quiz Helps You Learn</h3>
<p>Why answer these questions?</p>
<p>Because you learn mathematics by doing it!</p>
<p>Just like learning guitar or tennis. Theory, then practice.</p>
<p>The questions are for you! So you can get practice.</p>
<p>Don't cheat yourself. Work hard on each question. Don't hurry, there is no time limit.</p>
<p>The quiz gets you to recall and use what you have learned. A proven way to learn.</p>

<h3>NOT a Test !</h3>
<p>The quiz is not a test, no one is judging you. Relax and enjoy learning.</p>

<h3>Take Your Time</h3>
<p>The questions are not timed ... take all day, and tomorrow as well if you want.</p>

<h3>Don't Cheat Yourself</h3>
<p>Taking shortcuts? Using a calculator to cheat? You may finish faster, but not learn anything! Then the whole thing is a waste of time.</p>

<h3>Pencil and Paper</h3>
<p>Use a pencil and paper when doing the questions ... make sketches, do sums.</p>
<p>Writing things down also helps you to learn.</p>

 
<h3>Right or Wrong you are a Winner</h3>
<p>Oh No! A wrong answer! Don't worry, trying your honest best to answer is what is important.</p>
<p>Think about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Got the right answer? Well Done! Now see how we solved it, you may learn new things. </li>
<li>Got it wrong? Then find out why you got it wrong and you are also a winner! You have learned something.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, learning from failure is one of the most important things for people to develop.</p>

<h3>Good for You</h3>
<p>Oh yes ... these questions are good for your mind, too.</p>
